## Purpose

This folder contains **AISET tool requirements** per DO-178C DAL D.

**⚠️ CRITICAL:**
- This is for **AISET tool requirements** (requirements for the software we are building)
- **NOT for user system requirements** (what AISET helps users capture)
- Source: `/REQUIREMENTS.md` (Level 4 specification output)

- [ ] `SRS_Software_Requirements_Specification.md` - AISET Software Requirements Specification
  - Will be derived from `/REQUIREMENTS.md` (currently v0.5.0, 85 requirements)
  - Format: DO-178C compliant SRS
